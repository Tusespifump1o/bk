Tridgell and Mackerras, 1996, the Rsync algorithm, Australian Nat Univ TR

- support gcs in storage_test.go (if env vars set)
- support gcs in bk_e2etest (don't use coldline, run from gcs)
- write unit tests for ReadMulti
- Finish writing readme.go
- sniff http to estimate gcs billing
  - or, is there a google aloud api that would do
- better progress report during regular backups
- disk: append to existing pack if it's not too big...
 -  but... file system atomicity stuff... don't like the idea of modifying
    any bits after they have landed in storage.
    bk repack <bk dir>?
 - can cat pack files together now. add a 'bk reindex' command?
 - also support for gcs?
